I’ve been building products since the age of twelve while growing up in
[Bridgewater, Nova
Scotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater,_Nova_Scotia) and was
introduced to technology and programming by my much older brother. Since then,
I’ve been incredibly passionate about technology, start ups, and how you can
change the world for the better with the combination of the two.

I enjoy giving [talks](/talks/) and [advising](#contact-me) on engineering process, technology, software
development, and how to make organizations and people more productive. Blogging
is an outlet for me to write about my experiences and to write down my
learnings (mostly for myself).

During the summer of 2007 before university, I started a video streaming
company called [LivePvP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxRUyR7J2E4) that
targeted video gamers which grew to 1.5m monthly page views and 150k unique
visitors. It was a blast and despite it being a failure as a business, it only
increased my passion for technology and startups.

After I graduated from [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca) in November 2011 I joined a
post-seed startup ([GoInstant](http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/goinstant-is-browser-sharing-with-no-downloads/)) which was [acquired by Salesforce](http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/09/salesforce-com-reported-to-buy-goinstant-for-70-million/) in 2012.
Afterwards, I became the Lead Engineer for a team of 25 that worked on our
[co-browse product](http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/goinstant-is-browser-sharing-with-no-downloads/), [GoInstant’s backend-as-a-service](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/17/goinstants-next-chapter-is-a-developer-platform-for-the-multiplayer-web/), and finally [Salesforce SOS](http://www.salesforce.com/ca/service-cloud/features/sos/).

I’m now working to help define Salesforce’s Embeddable SDK strategy for the
Service Cloud and currently reside in [Halifax, Nova Scotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax,_Nova_Scotia).
